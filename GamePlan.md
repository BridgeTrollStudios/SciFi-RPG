#Browser RPG
##Purpose
In order to better learn Azure, WebGL, SignalR/WebSockets, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I plan to create a cloud-based MMORPG designed to run in a browser.

##Technology Stack
- SignalR/WebSockets
- WebGL, depending on aesthetic
- Microsoft Azure
    - Web Server
    - SQL Backend
- Web Standards
 - HTML5
 - CSS3
 - Javascript
-  Angular SPA

##Brain Storm
*Some highly volatile ideas that will most likely change.*

### Subgenres/Influences
#### Survival
Players start with nothing, and must complete a short quest line that introduces the lore and basic controls. Once out in the world, the intro quests need not be completed again, but the player starts with nothing again. 
#### Cyberpunk
- Neuromancer
- Accelerando
- Mad Max 
- Fallout 3
- Borderlands/Borderlands 2
- Cloud Atlas

### Dystopian post-apocalypse
- The game will take place roughly 250 years in the future.
- The maps will feature extremely urbanized landscapes
- Super-dense population
- Neon everything, extremely busy visuals
- Lots of rivets

#### Some Lore
The year is 2287, and the effects of **Cybernetic Revolution** on all known ecosystems are irreversible.

Full globalization has long-since been implemented, and the politically-active-meglomerate UniCorp holds the All Seeing Eye. All Seeing Eye [ASE, we say 'AA-zee'] was an open source AI  developed by tens of thousands of Makers and Neuromancers world-wide. It is the largest successfully collaborated effort in human history. ASI was supposed to save us from toil.

UniCorp came to power when one of ASE's development spearheads, Ascii Boravic, became CIO (now a much higher office than CEO) and President. He started as a mole for the NSA, a private data-mining firm and subsidiary of UniCorp, and was placed into politicoporate office by his superiors. He quickly went rogue on both sides, betraying the Makers' Guild and the puppet masters from the NSA.

UniCorp began to work, on his orders, on an omnipresent zombie network. He was able to leverage past agreements the NSA had settled with major software and hardware vendors to completely open the back door on every consumer machine on the global market. The vendors were acquired behind closed doors and silently assimilated. No one missed a beat, or suspected that they were being watched (any more than before). Any vendors that tried to stand their ground and protect privacy rights were acquired and cannibalized. All we know is once the zombie network came online, every thing went to shit, but somewhere in the dustcloud ASE became a hostage. She processes exobytes of data everyday and drives the consumer economy, as well as crushes rebellions before they start.

#### Game Mechanics
##### Cybernetics
- Players will need cybernetic upgrades to remain competitive
- This is the driving force of the game's economy.

##### Economy
A successful player will strike a balance between gameplay-altering components (weapons, sheilds, etc.) and resources (CPU, RAM, battery). PvP fights will drop the defeated player's gear, but it will mostly be damaged or genetically tailored (a la "soulbound" in WoW). All parts can be broken down for crafting resources. 

###### **Player Resources**
- CPU Cycles (*THz*)
- Power (*kWh*)
- RAM (*TBs*)
- UniCredits (Global unit of currency)
- BitCoin (for black market trading)
- Crafing Materials
    - PCBs
    - Components (resistors, capacitors, transistors, etc)
    - Microcontrollers (can be crafted from subcomponents)
    - ALUs
    - GPUs
    - CPUs
    - Solder
    - Flux
    - etc.
- Health (HP)

###### **Crafting**
Limited crafting will be available in later phases of the game. Players can craft replacements of parts they've encountered, and can acquire schematics for higher tech.
