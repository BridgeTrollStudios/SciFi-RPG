#### Some Lore

The year is 2287, and the effects of **Cybernetic Revolution** on all known ecosystems are irreversible.

Full globalization has long-since been implemented, and the politically-active-meglomerate UniCore holds the All Seeing Eye. All Seeing Eye [ASE, we say 'AA-zee'] was an open source AI  developed by tens of thousands of Makers and Neuromancers world-wide. It is the largest successfully collaborated effort in human history. ASI was supposed to save us from toil.

UniCore came to power when one of ASE's development spearheads, Ascii Boravic, became CIO (now a much higher office than CEO) and President. He started as a mole for the NSA, a private data-mining firm and subsidiary of UniCore, and was placed into politicoporate office by his superiors. He quickly went rogue on both sides, betraying the Makers' Guild and the puppet masters from the NSA.

UniCorp began to work, on his orders, on an omnipresent zombie network. He was able to leverage past agreements the NSA had settled with major software and hardware vendors to completely open the back door on every consumer machine on the global market. The vendors were acquired behind closed doors and silently assimilated. No one missed a beat, or suspected that they were being watched (any more than before). Any vendors that tried to stand their ground and protect privacy rights were acquired and cannibalized. All we know is once the zombie network came online, every thing went to shit, but somewhere in the dustcloud ASE became a hostage. She processes exobytes of data everyday.
